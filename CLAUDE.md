# Context
- This is a SDK that is written exclusively in Swift. It is called ButchSDK
- We only use native components and extend them.
- The code needs to be super lean.
- All components need to be fitting a pattern that they match an SDK and are super easy to use for other applications.
- Keep in mind that all "struct", "init" and "view bodies" need to be public so that the elemnts can be used as library components.
- Documentation of any kind is in an extra folder in the Documentation.docc of this SDK. Please read and update all documentaiton there. Other places are not allowed for documensations or .md-files of any kind.
