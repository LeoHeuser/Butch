# Context
- This is a SDK that is written exclusively in Swift. It is called ButchSDK
- We only use native components and extend them.
- The code needs to be super lean.
- All components need to be fitting a pattern that they match an SDK and are super easy to use for other applications.
- Keep in mind that all "struct", "init" and "view bodies" need to be public so that the elemnts can be used as library components.
- Documentation of any kind is documented in the header area of each code file.
