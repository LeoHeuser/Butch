 # StringTable
 Which catalog a ButchKit string is looked up in. ButchKit ships no strings of its own: every
 `LocalizedStringKey` it renders resolves in the consuming app's bundle, so the app owns the
 wording and the translations, and the paywall speaks every language the app does.
 
 Three tables are the convention:
 - `Localizable` — everything by default, buttons included. SwiftUI's own default, so it needs no
   name.
 - `Errors` — anything the user reads because something went wrong. Use `Text(error:)`.
 - `Accessibility` — labels, hints and values only assistive technologies read.
 
 A key rendered without a table lands in `Localizable`, which is the right answer for a button
 even when that button sits in an alert: `button.ok` is a button, not an error.

    /// The bundle stays at its default, which means `Bundle.main` -- the consuming app, exactly
