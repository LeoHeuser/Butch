# ButchSDK
A SwiftUI component library and UX guidance for developers and designers who value great user experience. Extends native Apple platform patterns with minimal code overhead, backed by comprehensive documentation and UX best practices.

Supports iOS/iPadOS 17.0+ and macOS 14.0+.

## Rules for building the components
All components within ButchSDK are 100% native Swift with no external dependencies. They support the structure of native UI components like buttons and text fields, extending them with proven usability patterns.

Core principles:
- **Keep it small**: Less code is always better
- **Rely on native components**: Extend what already exists
- **Use tokens**: Make it scalable and accessible
- **Prioritize performance and modularity**: Every component must be performant to ensure outstanding overall performance
